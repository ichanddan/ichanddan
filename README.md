I currently work at **Aiqwip** as a **Software Engineer**, where I focus on building scalable full-stack applications, contributing to system design, optimizing performance, and delivering high-quality features in collaboration with cross-functional teams.

Previously, I worked at **Aasa Technology** as a **Full Stack Developer**, where I developed end-to-end web applications using **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. My role involved designing and maintaining RESTful APIs, integrating frontend and backend systems, improving application security and scalability, and supporting deployment and production environments.

I began my professional journey as a **Frontend Developer Intern**, progressing to **Frontend Developer**, where I built responsive and accessible user interfaces using **React.js and Tailwind CSS**. During this phase, I focused heavily on performance optimization, improving page load times by **10%** and increasing user engagement by **30%**.

With a strong foundation in frontend engineering and solid backend expertise, I enjoy building clean, maintainable, and scalable applications while continuously learning and adapting to new technologies.
